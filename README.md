# Unreal ORM Monorepo

Welcome to the Unreal ORM monorepo! This repository contains the source code for the Unreal ORM for SurrealDB, as well as documentation and supporting tools.

> **Looking for the ORM package?**
> See [`packages/unreal-orm/README.md`](packages/unreal-orm/README.md) for detailed usage, API, and design docs for the ORM itself.

This repository is organized as a monorepo, making it easy to develop, test, and document the ORM in one place.
