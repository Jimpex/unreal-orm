This release introduces powerful new features, significant architectural improvements, and a more streamlined developer experience. Key highlights include a new `merge` method for partial updates, support for a wide array of advanced data types, and a decoupled API for defining indexes.

<Aside type="tip" title="Contributor Focus">
  The codebase has been significantly refactored for clarity and maintainability, making it easier than ever for the community to contribute. Alongside this, our test suite has grown to **141 tests**, ensuring a stable and reliable foundation for future development.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Partial Updates with `merge`**: Introduced `instance.merge(db, data)` and `Model.merge(db, data)` for performing partial record updates, aligning with SurrealDB's `MERGE` statement. This is now the recommended way to update specific fields without fetching and sending the entire record.
- **Expanded Data Type Support**: Added comprehensive, type-safe support for most of SurrealDB's advanced data types, including:
  - `Field.any()`
  - `Field.decimal()`
  - `Field.float()`
  - `Field.int()`
  - `Field.bytes()`
  - `Field.duration()`
  - `Field.uuid()`
  - `Field.geometry()` (with type-safe definitions for specific geometry types)
- **Flexible Fields**: Added a `flexible: true` option to `Field.object()` and `Field.custom()` to support SurrealDB's `FLEXIBLE` keyword, allowing for dynamic, schema-less fields within structured models.
- **Decoupled Index Definitions**: Indexes are now defined separately from tables using a new `Index.define()` API. This improves separation of concerns and simplifies the table definition API.

## üöÄ Improvements & Refactors

- **Unified Schema API**: The `applySchema` and `generateFullSchemaQl` functions now accept a single array of definable items (e.g., `[User, UserEmailIndex]`), simplifying the schema management process.
- **Clearer Table Definition**: `Table.define` has been replaced with `Table.normal()` and `Table.relation()` to make the distinction between standard and edge tables explicit and type-safe.
- **Instance-level `delete`**: Added an `instance.delete(db)` method for more intuitive record deletion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes

- **Schema Generation**: Fixed an issue where the schema generator would emit redundant `WHERE` clauses for raw permission strings.
- **Query Engine**: Correctly implemented support for `vars` bindings in queries and enforced that `orderBy` clauses use a valid `order` direction.
- **Field Definitions**: Prevented the schema generator from emitting duplicate `field[*]` definitions for array fields.
- **Package Compatibility**: Set the `module` field in `package.json` to `dist/index.js` to ensure correct module resolution in various environments.

## üìö Documentation

- **JSDoc Coverage**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments with examples to all core functions, types, and classes, providing rich IntelliSense in supported editors.
- **New Guides & Cookbook**: Added a detailed tutorial, a cookbook with practical recipes (e.g., pagination, soft-delete), and updated the README with a quick-start guide.
- **Starlight Migration**: All documentation has been migrated to a modern, searchable Starlight-powered site.

## üí• Breaking Changes

- The `indexes` property has been removed from `Table.define` options. Indexes must now be created separately using the new `Index.define()` function.
- `Table.define` is deprecated. Use `Table.normal()` for standard tables and `Table.relation()` for edge tables instead.
