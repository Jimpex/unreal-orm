This release includes an important bug fix for schema generation, ensuring consistent behavior when using the `OVERWRITE` and `IF NOT EXISTS` methods.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes

### Schema Generation

- **Fixed OVERWRITE method application**: The `OVERWRITE` and `IF NOT EXISTS` methods were only being applied to `DEFINE TABLE` statements, but not to `DEFINE FIELD` or `DEFINE INDEX` statements. This inconsistency has been resolved by ensuring these methods are now consistently applied to all schema definition statements (tables, fields, and indexes).

  This fix ensures that when using schema generation with the `OVERWRITE` method, all schema elements will be properly overwritten as expected, providing consistent behavior across the entire schema.

  ```typescript
  // Now correctly applies OVERWRITE to table, fields, and indexes
  await applySchema(db, [User, UserEmailIndex], "OVERWRITE");
  ```

## üß™ Tests

- Added comprehensive tests to verify that the `OVERWRITE` and `IF NOT EXISTS` methods are correctly applied to all schema definition types.
